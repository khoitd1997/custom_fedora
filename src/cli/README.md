Must have init run and then install can run

in var/lib/mock is the chroot, clean will remove it

/var/lib/name, name is determined by root var, different chroot won't share same dnf cache

Mock refreshes dnf.conf every invocation

Maybe /libexec for all other files and just the main one in /usr/bin

Support classic kickstart file but with additional settings through the TOML file like caching.

## Dependency list

sudo dnf install spdlog
